# Digit-Classification
This Digit Classification project is developed on a neural network model which is capable of accurately identifying handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset.

**IMPLEMENTATION:**
The project is implemented using Python and the Keras library and it also make use of visualization tools such as Matplotlib and TensorBoard to visualize the neural network's performance.The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

**USES:**
This model can be used in various applications, such as OCR systems and automated postal sorting
